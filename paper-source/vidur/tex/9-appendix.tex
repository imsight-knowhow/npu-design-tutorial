\subsection{Impact of Request Arrival Rate on Fidelity for Dynamic Workloads}

We present additional fidelity results for \sysname at different request arrival rates in \autoref{fig:fidelty-dynamic-trace-95}. We find that \sysname retains high fidelity even at 95\% of maximum system capacity for larger models, however, for \llamaS, where we have slightly higher error due to CPU overheads, the errors cascade and we see up to 12.65\% maximum error. We also provide  the error trends in \autoref{fig:fidelty-dynamic-trace-trends}.

\subsection{Cost Breakdown of What-if Analysis}

\sysname's ability to efficiently and accurate simulated complex deployment scenarios allows us to explore search configuration spaces at cheap negligible cost. The what-if analysis presented in \autoref{fig:intro:optimal-configs}, required a total of 35,565 runs, with a total projected GPU duration of 1,139,865 dollars. The same search completes takes only $\sim12.5$ hours on a 96-core CPU machine costing just \$125. The breakdown of each task is presented in \autoref{table:tbl-eval-whatif}.

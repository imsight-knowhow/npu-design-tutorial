# extern/

Third-party source checkouts live here (typically cloned with `--depth 1`).

- This directory is for convenience when browsing upstream code alongside this repo.
- Checked out sources are ignored by Git via `extern/.gitignore`.
- If you need to vendor or patch an external dependency, do not put it here—add it as a proper dependency or submodule instead.
